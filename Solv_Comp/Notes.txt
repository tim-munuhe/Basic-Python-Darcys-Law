- matrix has to be symmetric positive definite
  -> = 0.5*(A + A^T) where A^T is transpose of randomly generated square matrix A
- iterative solvers: conjugate gradient, gauss-seidel
- direct solvers: gauss-jordan, LU/cholesky factorization


for debug
- A one time, b one time, and x by iteration

Suspect matrix generation process is not good for current system
-> add some factor to diagonal to make matrix positive definite

if (N < 10): x_out = np.copy(x)

if (N < 10): np.hstack((x_out, x))
